Empowering The Patient

HMA empowers patients to have records stored in a structured
format that will enable stakeholders to access and understand
their contents in a streamlined fashion. Most importantly, the
patient will be able to control the privacy settings of their stored
data thereby allowing them to enable and disable access with
relative ease. Finally, the user will be able to access their data
from anywhere and at any time- through mobile devices.
Blockchain Storage And Data Encryption
Bypassing the security protocols of a blockchain is nearly
impossible. Additionally, all data will be stored in an encrypted
format that will further boost it’s security.

Encourages Transparency
The current system of data management does not share data
in a uniform manner. The system is notorious for not prioritizing
the patient and enabling only a one-way communication
channel. Every HMA token holder will have a complete record of
all the transactions of payments done at different hospitals, and
pharmacies.

Putting value to healthcare sector via a Coin
The main feature of the HMA Coin is that it is sustained by
Healthcare assets in multiple forms, with the mission to create
a stable coin with high income. It will help the community and
the people to hold a real value currency that they can rely on to
put their savings. It will help them get access to healthcare in a
lucrative manner.
Insurance
We’re used to having insurance for our medical bills, lives and cars,
but today’s multi-trillion-dollar insurance industry has plenty of
problems, including inefficiency, fraud, human error and, most
concerning of all, cyberattacks. Blockchain’s ability to create
trust in a trustless ecosystem through the use of public ledgers
and fortified cybersecurity protocols has positive implications
for the insurance industry’s future growth. Along with artificial
intelligence and big data, the potential that utilizing blockchain
in insurance will unlock hinges upon three unique features in
particular.
